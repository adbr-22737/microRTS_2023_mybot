# Bot for microRTS 2023

As part of a module I'm taking this semester, I had to implement a bot for this contest. This is the result of my work, which unfortunately didn't turn out quite as I would have liked and probably could have done by now. But I had only little time and in the lecture it took some time until we got to the interesting RL algorithms, so I started with a simpler concept and stayed with it.
Nevertheless, I'd like to try my luck with this bot.

Both "GrabAndShakeBot" and "RealGrabAndShakeBot" should work. So if the competition has enough processing power available, you can run both.
